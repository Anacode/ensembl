# If you use the provided upload script, commentlines and

1	embl_acc	EMBL accession

2	status	Status

3	synonym	Synonym

4	name	Name

5	type	Type of feature

# A seq_region that is not represented in a more global coordinate system
# should get the toplevel attribute and value 1
# If you have more than one assembly in you database, this feature will
# not work as expected. You should then explicitly request features in a specific
# cordinate system
6	toplevel	Top Level	Top Level Non-Redundant Sequence Region

# The number of genes on each seq_region is counted and stored under this
# seq_region_attribute to be displayed on mapview. Mainly web code uses this.
7	GeneCount	Gene Count	Total Number of Genes

# Same as above for known genes
8	KnownGeneCount	Known Gene Count	Total Number of Known Genes

# same as above for pseudogenes. The criteria for a pseudogene is,
# that the gene.type fieled matches /pseudogene/
9	PseudoGeneCount	PseudoGene Count	Total Number of PseudoGenes

# Snps on a seq_region. See above.
10	SNPCount	SNP Count	Total Number of SNPs

# another seq_region attribute. When a seq_region should be used with a 
# different codon table this attrbutes value should contain its number.
# This is a bioperl codon table, find out from there which number to use 
# for your seq_region
# Useful for Mitochondrium and Bacteria with non standard codon tables
11	codon_table	Codon Table	Alternate codon table

# This is an attribute for a translation. Values describe start and end
# position of a seelnocystein in a Translation (Amino Acid coordinates)
# Example: "123 123 U". This is the general sequence edit format.
# Other attributess with sequence edits for different reasons will come
# up in the future
12	_selenocysteine	Selenocysteine

13	bacend	bacend

# Contains the htg phase for clones. 
14	htg	htg	High Throughput phase attribute

15	miRNA	Micro RNA	Coordinates of the mature miRNA

# A sequence region that you consider not part of the reference genome should
# be tagged as non_ref in seq_region_attrib. Chromosome 6 haplotypes in human are
# exmaples of that. 
16	non_ref	Non Reference	Non Reference Sequence Region

17	sanger_project	Sanger Project name

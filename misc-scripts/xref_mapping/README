THe following is the initial first draft/initial mind dump which will be tidiedup. 

The Xref tables are created and populated by the scripts in this directory.
The process can be viewed as a two part process. 
First parsing of the data and secondly mapping these to the Ensembl data.

Parsing.


what data is stored.

All species have the same "core" set of data which consists of 


source name	      Parser(s) used to populate
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Uniprot/SPtrembl      UniProtParser.pm  
Uniprot/Swissprot     UniProtParser.pm
Refseq                RefSeqGPFFParser.pm
MIM                   UniProtParser.pm + RefSeqGPFFParser.pm
PDB		      UniProtParser.pm
EMBL		      UniProtParser.pm
Protein_id            UniProtParser.pm
LocusLink	      RefSeqGPFFParser.pm
GO		      GOParser.pm
Interpro	      InterproParser.pm (no link to primary_xref, special case)
*pubmed               UniProtParser.pm + RefSeqGPFFParser.pm
*medline              UniProtParser.pm + RefSeqGPFFParser.pm
*mim2                 MIMParser.pm


* are new data sources.

Species specific data:-


source name		species		parser 
------------------------------------------------------
HUGO		     	Human		HUGOParser.pm
MarkerSymbol (MGD/MGI)	Mouse		MGDParser.pm
RGD                  	Rat        	RGDParser.pm
ZFIN                 	Zebrafish  	ZFINParser.pm



General Tutorial

The perl script to create and populate the database is xref_parser.pl

  xref_parser --help produces:-

xref_parser.pl -user {user} -pass {password} -host {host} -port {port} 
	-dbname {database} -species {species1,species2} 
	-source {source1,source2} -skipdownload -create

If no source is specified then then all source are loaded. The same is done for
species so it is best to specify this one or the script may take a while.


So to load/parse all the xrefs for the human the command would be:-

  xref_parser.pm -host host1 -port 3350 -user admin -pass password 
                 -dbname xref_store -species human -create



So we now have a set of xrefs that are dependent on the uniprot and refseq 
entries loaded. These can then be mapped to the ENSEMBL entitys with the 
xref_mapper.pl script.


The parsers.


UniProtParser.pm

Each record is stored as an xref and a primary_xref.
The accession is the main key and is taken from the AC line.
Any DR line that matches a valid source name (in the database) will
be processed and stored as xrefs and dependent xrefs. Currently these 
are MIM, PDB, EMBL In addition protein_id is taken from the EMBL line.
NOTE: InterPro is not loaded here as Interpro does not match InterPro 
(note capital P here). This is loaded seperately via the interpro parser.
New entries are now added for the medline and pubmed lines by parsing RX 
lines with MEDLINE or PUBMED xrefs.
Species specific files are parsed here so all records are stored.



RefSeqGPFFParser.pm	

Each record is stored as an xref and a primary_xref.
The accession is the main key and is taken from the AC line.
LocusLink, OMIM, pubmed and medline are stored as xrefs and dependent xref. 
Species specific files are parsed here so all records are stored.


GOParser.pm

Will only add entries if uniprot or refseq entry has been loaded already.
ENSEMBL entries are also ignored as these will only map onto themselves.
Most GO entries will already exist in the xref table (from Uniprot parsing) 
but most will not have the description, so this is added if there is none. 
Dependent xrefs are created if they do not exist already.


InterproParser.pm

The xrefs are stored for each Interpro but NO dependent xrefs are stored. 
Instead a seperate table is populated (interpro) with the interpro/pfam 
mappings. Uniprot/Refseq accesions are NOT checked to see if they are already 
in the database, therefore is species non-specific, but the xref is stored 
with the species specified in the run. 


MIMParser.pm

Uses the Gene names to map the mim numbers to the protein accessions via the
HUGO numbers. So HUGO has to be parsed already aswell as Uniprot and Refseq.
These are stored as MIM2 at present and are expected to replace the disease
database.


HUGOParser.pm, MGDParser.pm, RGDParser.pm, ZFINParser.pm

Uniprot and Refseq must be already be parsed. Entries are added to the
xref table and the dependent xref linked to the proteins (if they have been 
loaded). So Entries are added if the accession is valid for uniprot or refseq
for that particular species.




NOTE: RefSeqParser.pm also exists and can be used to parse the fasta type
files for the Refseq's.  At the moment The genbank style files are passed for 
both protein and rna files. But the xrefs are on a whole are just duplicated
as they contain bascially the same xref data. A decision will have to be made
as to the benefits/disadvantages of this. The alternative is to pass the rna 
as a fasta. (which i think is what the old system used to do, judging by the
numbers of xrefs).

UniProt/Swissprot - Uniprot/Trembl (UNIversal PROTein resource)
----------------------------------
 
The files cans come in two types;

1) contains data for all species
ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/uniprot/knowledgebase/uniprot_sprot.dat.gz
or 
ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/uniprot/knowledgebase/uniprot_trembl.dat.gz
This is the normal case.

2) contains data for that one species
ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/integr8/uniprot/proteomes/17.D_melanogaster.dat.gz


These are primary xrefs in that they contain sequence and hence can be mapped 
to the ensembl entities via normal alignment methods (we use exonerate).


Below is a list of dependent xrefs that might be added.
UniGene
EMBL
PDB
protein_id
GO
MIM_GENE     (human only)
MIM_MORBID   (human only)
HUGO         (human only)
MarkerSymbol (mouse only) aka MGI.


Refseq_peptide
--------------

The files come in two types those for specific species i.e.
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Canis_familiaris/protein/protein.gbk.gz

or as a series of numbered none specific species files i.e.
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/refseq/release/vertebrate_other/vertebrate_other3.protein.gpff.gz

These files are parsed by the parser RefSeqGPFFParser.pm

These are primary xrefs in that they contain sequence and hence can be mapped 
to the ensembl entities via normal alignment methods (we use exonerate).

Below is a list of dependent xrefs that might be added.
GO
EntrezGene
HUGO (human only)
RGD (rat only) 

Refseq_dna
----------

The files come in two types those for specific species i.e.
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Gallus_gallus/RNA/rna.gbk.gz


or as a series of numbered none specific species files i.e.
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/refseq/release/vertebrate_mammalian/vertebrate_mammalian46.rna.fna.gz

These files are parsed by the parser RefSeqParser.pm

These are primary xrefs in that they contain sequence and hence can be mapped 
to the ensembl entities via normal alignment methods (we use exonerate).

Below is a list of dependent xrefs that might be added.
HUGO (human only)
RGD  (rat only)


IPI (International Protein Index)
---

comes as species specific file i.e.
ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/IPI/current/ipi.HUMAN.fasta.gz

The files have something like :-

>IPI:IPI00000005.1|SWISS-PROT:P01111|TREMBL:Q5U091|ENSEMBL:ENSP00000261444;ENSP00000358548|REFSEQ:NP_002515|VEGA:OTTHUMP00000013879 Tax_Id=9606 GTPase NRas precursor
seqeunce..................

But most of the header information is ignored except for the description and 
the IPI value. The sequence is used to position the ipi xref.


These are primary xrefs in that they contain sequence and hence can be mapped 
to the ensembl entities via normal alignment methods (we use exonerate).

Has no dependent xrefs.


UniGene
-------

comes as species specific file i.e.
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/repository/UniGene/Bos_taurus/Bt.seq.uniq.gz 
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/repository/UniGene/Bos_taurus/Bt.data.gz


These are primary xrefs in that they contain sequence and hence can be mapped 
to the ensembl entities via normal alignment methods (we use exonerate).
Also loaded via the Uniprot!!! 

Has no dependent xrefs.


AgilentProbe
------------

This is a local and is not down loaded automatically via ftp so an AgilentProbe
the file must be copied by hand. this will be some thing like:-
LOCAL:AgilentProbe/HumanExpression.fasta

These are primary xrefs in that they contain sequence and hence can be mapped 
to the ensembl entities via normal alignment methods (we use exonerate).

Has no dependent xrefs.

AgilentCGH
----------

This is a local and is not down loaded automatically via ftp so an AgilentProbe
the file must be copied by hand. this will be some thing like:-
LOCAL:AgilentCGH/HumanCGH.fasta


These are primary xrefs in that they contain sequence and hence can be mapped 
to the ensembl entities via normal alignment methods (we use exonerate).

Has no dependent xrefs.



EMBL
----

These are dependent xrefs and are linked to ensembl via the Uniprot entrys.


PDB
---

Protein Data Bank entries are dependent xrefs and are linked to ensembl via the
Uniprot entrys.


protein_id
----------

These are dependent xrefs and are linked to ensembl via the Uniprot entrys.


PUBMED + Medline
----------------

These are no longer stored due to the large numbers of these. If you want to 
add these then see the UniprotParser and RefseqPArser for more details.


GO
--

Can come in a species specific file or can contain all species.
ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/GO/goa/UNIPROT/gene_association.goa_uniprot.gz
ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/GO/goa/HUMAN/gene_association.goa_human.gz

GO information in the Uniprot and refseq files are ignored and just the information 
from the above files are used. The files have references to uniprot and refseq entries
and so the GO entries are set to be dependent xref on these.


EntrezGene
----------

gene-centered information at NCBI is stored as a depenedent xref and is obtained 
from the refseq entires.



Interpro
--------

InterPro is a database of protein families, domains and functional sites and 
gets it data from the file:-
ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/interpro/interpro.xml.gz

NOTE: Interpro has its own table and hence the xrefs are stored but are not linked to
the ensembl entities directly but a list of interpro and identifiers are stored.
The identifiers stored are of the type :-
PROSITE, PFAM, PRINTS, PREFILE, PROFILE, TIGRFAMs





UniProt/Varsplic
----------------

Alternative splice forms are obtained from the follwing file;-
ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/uniprot/knowledgebase/uniprot_sprot_varsplic.fasta.gz


These are primary xrefs in that they contain sequence and hence can be mapped 
to the ensembl entities via normal alignment methods (we use exonerate).

Has no dependent xrefs.


ncRNA,RFAM,miRNA_Registry
-------------------------

This is a local and is not down loaded automatically via ftp so you must copy this 
file first before running the parser.
LOCAL:ncRNA/ncRNA.txt

These are direct xrefs so the file contains data on what the xref is and which 
ensembl entity it matches too.


SPECIES SPECIFIC ENTRYS
-----------------------
-----------------------


Human
-----


MIM - Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man
-----------------------------------------

Descriptions and types are obtained from the file:-
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/repository/OMIM/omim.txt.Z

This creates two set of xrefs these being :-

1) MIM_GENE   (disease genes and other expressed gene)
2) MIM_MORBID (the disease genes)

Note those in set 2 will also be in set 1.

These MIM xrefs are linked to UniProt/SwissProt entries using the 
UniProtParser.pm creating dependent xrefs. Note if the Swissprot Entrie does
not specify wether the MIM entrie is a phenotype or a gene then it is ignored.
Fro this same reason MIM dependent xrefs are NOT obtained from the refseq 
entries  

So when the swissport entries are matched to ensembl the MIM
entries will also be matched.


HUGO
----

The Human Genome Organisation xrefs are obtained from using the following url:-

http://www.gene.ucl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/nomenclature/gdlw.pl?title=Genew+output+data
&col=gd_hgnc_id&col=gd_app_sym&col=gd_app_name&col=gd_prev_sym&col=gd_aliases
&col=md_prot_id&col=gd_pub_refseq_ids&status=Approved&status=Approved+Non-Human
&status_opt=3&=on&where=&order_by=gd_hgnc_id&limit=&format=text&submit=submit
&.cgifields=&.cgifields=status&.cgifields=chr

Which is a script that produces a list of HUGO identifiers with the uniprot and
refseq entries they are linked to.

The files have references to uniprot and refseq entries and so the GO entries are 
set to be dependent xref on these.

NOTE: due to length of its name the file is stored in the name of its checksum.


OTTT
----

These are the direct mapping between the vega genes and ensembl ones. Not all
of these are mapped but a fair proportion are.
These create direct xrefs. 
the file used should be :-
LOCAL:OTTT/OTTT.txt 


CCDS
----

The CCDS database identifies a core set of human protein coding regions that
are consistently annotated by multiple public resources and pass quality tests.

A local file is used here:-
LOCAL:CCDS/CCDS.txt 

The file contains a list of ccds identifiers and the ensembl entities they match to.
So direct xrefs are created for these.



Mouse
-----

MarkerSymbol
------------

Also known as MGI.

ftp://ftp.informatics.jax.org/pub/reports/MRK_SwissProt_TrEMBL.rpt
ftp://ftp.informatics.jax.org/pub/reports/MRK_Synonym.sql.rpt

This is mouse specific xref being the Mouse Genome Informatics data.
The files have references to uniprot entries and so the GO entries are 
set to be dependent xrefs on these.


Rat
---

RGD
--

Rat Genome Database entires are populate by using the file:-
ftp://rgd.mcw.edu/pub/data_release/GENES

The rgd xrefs are dependent xrefs on the refseq entries.



Zebra fish
----------

ZFIN_ID
-------

The two files
http://zfin.org/data_transfer/Downloads/refseq.txt 
http://zfin.org/data_transfer/Downloads/swissprot.txt
contain list of zfin identifiers and refseq or swissprot indentifiers depending 
on the file.  

This creates a set of dependent xrefs on refseq and uniprot entries.  


C Elegans
---------


wormpep_id , wormbase_locus, wormbase_gene, wormbase_transcript
--------------------------------------------------------------- 

Uses the file 
ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/databases/wormpep/wormpep150/wormpep.table150

and the database (last release should do)
mysql:ensembldb.ensembl.org::caenorhabditis_elegans_core_39_150a:anonymous

This creates direct xrefs for all these.

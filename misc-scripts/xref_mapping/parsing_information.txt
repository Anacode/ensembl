UniProt/Swissprot - UniProt/Trembl (UNIversal PROTein resource)
---------------------------------------------------------------

The files cans come in two types:

1)  Contains data for all species

    ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/uniprot/knowledgebase/uniprot_sprot.dat.gz

    or

    ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/uniprot/knowledgebase/uniprot_trembl.dat.gz

    This is the normal case.

2)  Contains data for that one species

    ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/integr8/uniprot/proteomes/17.D_melanogaster.dat.gz


These are primary Xrefs in that they contain sequence and hence can be
mapped to the Ensembl entities via normal alignment methods (we use
exonerate).


Below is a list of dependent Xrefs that might be added:

    EMBL
    PDB
    protein_id
    GO
    MIM_GENE     (human only)
    MIM_MORBID   (human only)
    HUGO         (human only)
    MarkerSymbol (mouse only) aka MGI.


Refseq_peptide
--------------

The files come in two types those for specific species i.e.

    ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Canis_familiaris/protein/protein.gbk.gz

or as a series of numbered none specific species files i.e.

    ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/refseq/release/vertebrate_other/vertebrate_other3.protein.gpff.gz

These files are parsed by the parser RefSeqGPFFParser.pm

These are primary Xrefs in that they contain sequence and hence can be
mapped to the Ensembl entities via normal alignment methods (we use
exonerate).

Below is a list of dependent Xrefs that might be added:

    GO
    EntrezGene
    HUGO (human only)
    RGD (rat only)


Refseq_dna
----------

The files come in two types those for specific species i.e.

    ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Gallus_gallus/RNA/rna.gbk.gz

or as a series of numbered none specific species files i.e.

    ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/refseq/release/vertebrate_mammalian/vertebrate_mammalian46.rna.fna.gz

These files are parsed by the parser RefSeqParser.pm

These are primary Xrefs in that they contain sequence and hence can be
mapped to the Ensembl entities via normal alignment methods (we use
exonerate).

Below is a list of dependent Xrefs that might be added:

    HUGO (human only)
    RGD  (rat only)


IPI (International Protein Index)
---------------------------------

Comes as species specific file i.e.

    ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/IPI/current/ipi.HUMAN.fasta.gz

The files have something like

>IPI:IPI00000005.1|SWISS-PROT:P01111|TREMBL:Q5U091|ENSEMBL:ENSP00000261444;ENSP00000358548|REFSEQ:NP_002515|VEGA:OTTHUMP00000013879 Tax_Id=9606 GTPase NRas precursor
seqeunce..................

But most of the header information is ignored except for the description
and the IPI value.  The sequence is used to position the ipi Xref.

These are primary Xrefs in that they contain sequence and hence can be
mapped to the Ensembl entities via normal alignment methods (we use
exonerate).

Has no dependent Xrefs.


UniGene
-------

Comes as species specific file i.e.

    ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/repository/UniGene/Bos_taurus/Bt.seq.uniq.gz
    ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/repository/UniGene/Bos_taurus/Bt.data.gz

These are primary Xrefs in that they contain sequence and hence can be
mapped to the Ensembl entities via normal alignment methods (we use
exonerate).  No longer loaded via UniProt.

Has no dependent Xrefs.


AgilentProbe
------------

This is a local and is not down loaded automatically via ftp so an
AgilentProbe the file must be copied by hand.  This will be some thing
like

    LOCAL:AgilentProbe/HumanExpression.fasta

These are primary Xrefs in that they contain sequence and hence can be
mapped to the Ensembl entities via normal alignment methods (we use
exonerate).

Has no dependent Xrefs.


AgilentCGH
----------

This is a local and is not down loaded automatically via ftp so an
AgilentProbe the file must be copied by hand.  This will be some thing
like

    LOCAL:AgilentCGH/HumanCGH.fasta

These are primary Xrefs in that they contain sequence and hence can be
mapped to the Ensembl entities via normal alignment methods (we use
exonerate).

Has no dependent Xrefs.


EMBL
----

These are dependent Xrefs and are linked to Ensembl via the UniProt
entries.


PDB
---

Protein Data Bank entries are dependent Xrefs and are linked to Ensembl
via the UniProt entries.


protein_id
----------

These are dependent Xrefs and are linked to Ensembl via the UniProt
entries.


PUBMED + Medline
----------------

These are no longer stored due to the large numbers of these.  If you
want to add these then see the UniProtParser and RefseqPArser for more
details.


GO
--

Can come in a species specific file or can contain all species.

    ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/GO/goa/UNIPROT/gene_association.goa_uniprot.gz
    ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/GO/goa/HUMAN/gene_association.goa_human.gz

GO information in the UniProt and Refseq files are ignored and just the
information from the above files are used.  The files have references to
UniProt and Refseq entries and so the GO entries are set to be dependent
Xref on these.


EntrezGene
----------

Gene-centered information at NCBI is stored as a depenedent Xref and is
obtained from the Refseq entires.


Interpro
--------

InterPro is a database of protein families, domains and functional sites
and gets it data from the file

    ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/interpro/interpro.xml.gz

NOTE:  Interpro has its own table and hence the Xrefs are stored but
are not linked to the Ensembl entities directly but a list of interpro
and identifiers are stored.  The identifiers stored are of the type

    PROSITE, PFAM, PRINTS, PREFILE, PROFILE, TIGRFAMs


UniProt/Varsplic
----------------

Alternative splice forms are obtained from the follwing file

    ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/uniprot/knowledgebase/uniprot_sprot_varsplic.fasta.gz

These are primary Xrefs in that they contain sequence and hence can be
mapped to the Ensembl entities via normal alignment methods (we use
exonerate).

Has no dependent Xrefs.


ncRNA, RFAM, miRNA_Registry
---------------------------

This is a local and is not down loaded automatically via ftp so you must
copy this file first before running the parser.

    LOCAL:ncRNA/ncRNA.txt

These are direct Xrefs so the file contains data on what the Xref is and
which Ensembl entity it matches too.


SPECIES SPECIFIC ENTRIES
------------------------
------------------------


Human
-----


MIM - Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man
-----------------------------------------

Descriptions and types are obtained from the file

    ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/repository/OMIM/omim.txt.Z

This creates two set of Xrefs:

1) MIM_GENE   (disease genes and other expressed gene)
2) MIM_MORBID (the disease genes)

Note those in set 2 will also be in set 1.

These MIM Xrefs are linked to UniProt/SwissProt entries using the
UniProtParser.pm creating dependent Xrefs.  Note if the Swissprot Entrie
does not specify wether the MIM entrie is a phenotype or a gene then it
is ignored.  For this same reason MIM dependent Xrefs are NOT obtained
from the Refseq entries.

So when the swissport entries are matched to Ensembl the MIM entries
will also be matched.


HUGO
----

The Human Genome Organisation Xrefs are obtained from using the
following url:

http://www.gene.ucl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/nomenclature/gdlw.pl?title=Genew+output+data
&col=gd_hgnc_id&col=gd_app_sym&col=gd_app_name&col=gd_prev_sym&col=gd_aliases
&col=md_prot_id&col=gd_pub_refseq_ids&status=Approved&status=Approved+Non-Human
&status_opt=3&=on&where=&order_by=gd_hgnc_id&limit=&format=text&submit=submit
&.cgifields=&.cgifields=status&.cgifields=chr

Which is a script that produces a list of HUGO identifiers with the
UniProt and Refseq entries they are linked to.

The files have references to UniProt and Refseq entries and so the GO
entries are set to be dependent Xref on these.

NOTE:  due to length of its name the file is stored in the name of its
checksum.


OTTT
----

These are the direct mapping between the vega genes and Ensembl
ones.  Not all of these are mapped but a fair proportion are.  These
create direct Xrefs.  The file used should be

    LOCAL:OTTT/OTTT.txt


CCDS
----

The CCDS database identifies a core set of human protein coding regions
that are consistently annotated by multiple public resources and pass
quality tests.

A local file is used here:

    LOCAL:CCDS/CCDS.txt 

The file contains a list of ccds identifiers and the Ensembl entities
they match to.  So direct Xrefs are created for these.


Mouse
-----

MarkerSymbol
------------

Also known as MGI.

    ftp://ftp.informatics.jax.org/pub/reports/MRK_SwissProt_TrEMBL.rpt
    ftp://ftp.informatics.jax.org/pub/reports/MRK_Synonym.sql.rpt

This is mouse specific Xref being the Mouse Genome Informatics data.
The files have references to UniProt entries and so the GO entries are
set to be dependent Xrefs on these.


Rat
---

RGD
--

Rat Genome Database entries are populate by using the file

    ftp://rgd.mcw.edu/pub/data_release/GENES

The rgd Xrefs are dependent Xrefs on the Refseq entries.


Zebra fish
----------

ZFIN_ID
-------

The two files

    http://zfin.org/data_transfer/Downloads/refseq.txt
    http://zfin.org/data_transfer/Downloads/swissprot.txt

contain list of zfin identifiers and Refseq or swissprot indentifiers
depending on the file.

This creates a set of dependent Xrefs on Refseq and UniProt entries.


C Elegans
---------

wormpep_id, wormbase_locus, wormbase_gene, wormbase_transcript
--------------------------------------------------------------- 

Uses the file

    ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/databases/wormpep/wormpep150/wormpep.table150

and the database (last release should do)

    mysql:ensembldb.ensembl.org::caenorhabditis_elegans_core_39_150a:anonymous

This creates direct Xrefs for all these.

ProteinAdaptor - DESCRIPTION of Object

=head1 SYNOPSIS

use Bio::EnsEMBL::DBSQL::DBAdaptor;


my $db = new Bio::EnsEMBL::DBSQL::DBAdaptor( -user   => 'root', 
                                             -db     => 'pog' , 
                                             -host   => 'caldy' , 
                                             -driver => 'mysql' );

my $protein_adaptor = $db->get_ProteinAdaptor();

my $protein = $protein_adaptor->fetch_by_transcript_id(1234);



=head1 DESCRIPTION

An adaptor which allows for the creation of Protein Objects from transcript
or translation ids. There is no Protein table in the EnsEMBL core database
and possibly this functionality should be moved into the translation object.

This directory is meant just to hold one DBAdaptor. This adaptor is specialized in
the way, that it just returns a DnaAlignFeatureAdaptor that can be connected
to a different DB than the core Database, making it possible to keep the Ests in a 
different db. 

The extra est - dna_align_feature database only needs to contain the dna_align_feature
table as in the core db. all other data is used from core DB, whose DBAdaptor has to be
attached to the DBAdaptor in this directory.

This might not be the final solution to the problem ....

=head1 NAME

Transcript - Confirmed Transcript object

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Give standard usage here

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Object that represents a confirmed transcript. 

=head1 CONTACT

Describe contact details here

=head1 APPENDIX

The rest of the documentation details each of the object methods. Internal methods are usually preceded with a _

# Let the code begin...


package Bio::EnsEMBL::Transcript;

# Object preamble - inheriets from Bio::SeqFeature::Generic

# new() is inherited from Bio::Root::Object

# _initialize is where the heavy stuff will happen when new is called

 Returns : Nothing

   # at the moment, use the SeqFeature sub hash. But in the future,
   # possibly do something better?

=head1 Methods inherieted from SeqFeature

=head2 start

 Returns : An array
 Args    : none


=head2 primary_tag

 Title   : primary_tag
 Usage   : $tag = $feat->primary_tag()
 Function: Returns the primary tag for a feature,
           eg 'exon'
 Returns : a string 
 Args    : none


=head2 source_tag

 Title   : source_tag
 Usage   : $tag = $feat->source_tag()

 Args    :


=head2 all_tags

 Title   : all_tags

 Function: gives all tags for this feature
 Returns : an array of strings
 Args    : none



=head2 gff_string

 Title   : gff_string
 Usage   : $str = $feat->gff_string
 Function: provides the feature information in GFF
           version 2 format.
 Returns : A string
 Args    : None



=head1 RangeI methods

These methods are inherited from RangeI and can be used
directly from a SeqFeatureI interface. Remember that a 
SeqFeature is-a RangeI, and so wherever you see RangeI you
can use a feature ($r in the below documentation).

=head2 overlaps

  Title   : overlaps
  Usage   : if($feat->overlaps($r)) { do stuff }
            if($feat->overlaps(200)) { do stuff }
  Function: tests if $feat overlaps $r
  Args    : a RangeI to test for overlap with, or a point
  Returns : true if the Range overlaps with the feature, false otherwise


=head2 contains

  Title   : contains
  Usage   : if($feat->contains($r) { do stuff }
  Function: tests whether $feat totally contains $r
  Args    : a RangeI to test for being contained
  Returns : true if the argument is totaly contained within this range


=head2 equals

  Title   : equals
  Usage   : if($feat->equals($r))
  Function: test whether $feat has the same start, end, strand as $r
  Args    : a RangeI to test for equality
  Returns : true if they are describing the same range


=head1 Geometrical methods

These methods do things to the geometry of ranges, and return
triplets (start, stop, strand) from which new ranges could be built.

=head2

  Title   : intersection
  Usage   : ($start, $stop, $strand) = $feat->intersection($r)
  Function: gives the range that is contained by both ranges
  Args    : a RangeI to compare this one to
  Returns : nothing if they don't overlap, or the range that they do overlap


=head2 union

  Title   : union
  Usage   : ($start, $stop, $strand) = $feat->union($r);
          : ($start, $stop, $strand) = Bio::RangeI->union(@ranges);
  Function: finds the minimal range that contains all of the ranges
  Args    : a range or list of ranges to find the union of
  Returns : the range containing all of the ranges

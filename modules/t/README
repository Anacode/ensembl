This directory contains a set of tests for the EnsEMBL API
modules. The test_genome.zip file contains the set of data 
that is used by the tests.

In order to run the tests you must update the MultiTestDB.conf
file with the information (username, host, etc.) for a mysql
instance where you have write permission. Running test case(s)
which require a database will automatically create and remove 
a temporary database during the test(s) execution.

To run multiple tests at once use the runtests.pl script in
the modules directory.  To run a single test simply execute
the .t file:

Examples:

#run all tests in the t directory
perl runtests.pl t

#run 3 tests
perl runtests.pl t/gene.t t/exon.t t/densityFeature.t

#run a single test
perl t/gene.t

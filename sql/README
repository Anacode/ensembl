24th May 1999

Contains tables for sql database but no data.  Also
contains raw sql queries for testing.

Lastly, contains a Tim Fulton's (preliminary) diagram of the 074 schema in
PDF format (attempts to make a gif/jpg out of this have so far failed
...). For now, the name is simply ensembl_0_7_4.pdf (the _0_7_4 bit applies
to the database schema, not to the pdf file).  

                                                                       Philip

Just a little documentation on how this is supposed to work:

- go to some igi working directory
- get all the data files
- make subdirs for each data source, containing their data file(s)
- run all-collates.sh. This will (or should) prepare one big gtf file foreach
  data source. The data is now ready to be merged. 
- run all-merges.sh. This will (or should) run all the pairwise, triple, (and
  higher) merges on all the single-source gtf files, and dump the resulting
  merged files into sub-directory merges/
- run all-stats.sh. This will run all the statistics on each of the
  merges. The output goes into sub-directory stats/

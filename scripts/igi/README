Just a little documentation on how this is supposed to work:

- go to some igi working directory
- get all the data files
- make subdirs for each data source, containing their data file(s)
- run all-collates.sh. This will (or should) prepare one big gtf file foreach
  data source in a new subdirectory out/collated/*.all
  The data is now ready to be merged. 
- run all-merges.sh. This will (or should) run all the pairwise, triple, (and
  higher) merges on all the single-source gtf files, and dump the resulting
  merged files into sub-directory out/merged/
- run all-stats.sh. This will (or should) run all the statistics on each of
  the merged files. The output goes into sub-directory out/stats/. It will
  also produce file that map igi's to native ids and vice versa, in directory
  out/mapping. It will output so-called summary files into out/summary, which
  contain 'gene' features that extend from the start of the left most exon
  found in any igi up to the end of the rightmost exon in any igi. The igi's
  included are those given by the -cluster_n parameter (currently 2), which
  says how many sources must 'report' an igi (i.e., predict something that fals
  in this igi) before it's included in this set. The summary files are then
  used to filter the merged/ files so that only the right cluster_n igi's are
  listed.

Just a little documentation on how this is supposed to work:

- go to some igi working directory
- get all the data files
- make subdirs for each data source, containing their data file(s)
- run all-collates.sh. This will prepare one big gtf file foreach data source
- run all-merges.sh. This will run all the pairwise, triple, (and higher) merges
  on all the single-source gtf files
- run all-stats.sh. This will run all the statistics on each of the merges .
- more to come!

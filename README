Gearing up for a real release. Read LICENSE for copying

http://ensembl.ebi.ac.uk/

which also has installation instructions.


Installation in a nutshell:

a) make sure you have an SQL db somewhere
b) make sure your DBI interface works with it
c) if it is not MySQL, change DBSQL so that the driver is your db
d) make sure you have the bioperl 0.6 tree in your PERL5LIB (and before any other bioperl)
e) make sure you have the ensembl/modules in your PERL5LIB
f) load data in database from the dump.
g) run clone2embl -getall -start 0 -end 1

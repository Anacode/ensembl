 This directory contains the source code to build an artemis
based corba server. It contains the following files:

 artemis.idl - the idl for the artemis viewer

Server side main functions:

  ensembl-artemis-server - fully operational ensembl artemis server,
                           really justs build a DB object from artemis-db-mysql
                           and lets it do the main business.
                           Needs popt libaries for command line processing

  test-artentry-server   - builds a object for the artemis entry. Mainly
                           used for testing and development

  test-artseq-server     - builds a object for just the sequence. Mainly
                           used fro testing and development

Server side implementations:

 artemis-db-mysql.[ch] - implementation of artemis database. Needs
                        artemis-mysql-impl, artemis-exon-impl,
                        artemis-qual-helper to work, and mysql libraries.

 artemis-mysql-impl.[ch] Implementation of sequnces, transcripts and
                         exons objects using artemis. Needs
                         artemis-exon-impl, artemis-qual-helper, and mysql
                         libaries


 artemis-exon-impl.[ch]  In memory implementation of exon objects. Does
                         not require any mysql database

 artemis-qual-helper.[ch] Routines for building qualifier structs for
                          artemis

Client side programs:

 test-artentry-client     Client for testing artentries

 test-artseq-client       Client for testing sequences.

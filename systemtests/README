System tests for data integrity:

1. dna_test.pl

This test checks the whole database and makes sure 
that all clones contain dna.

3. every_atleast.pl

This test checks the whole database and makes sure 
that every gene has at least one transcript, and 
every transcript at least one exon. Also, it checks 
that every transcript with a translation has a 
correct start and end exons.

3. transcript_strand.pl

This test checks the whole database and makes sure 
that exons of transcripts on the same internal contig 
are on the same strand. 

4. stop_codons_test.pl

This test checks the whole database and makes sure 
that the translations of all genes do not contain 
any stop codons.

5. exon_duplicates.pl

This test checks the whole database and makes sure 
that there are no duplicated exons within a transcript

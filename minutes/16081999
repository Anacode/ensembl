Michele reviewed Ewan's database access code.

Obj.pm - locks on write code

Checking for existing genes before writing.

On updated genes we decided to keep everything and add two tags into the database.  Version and a status (current/obsolete) tag for Gene, Transcript and Exon.

Need write_Contig and write_Clone methods (Michele)

Sequence caching - could end up with the whole database in a cache.  We probably need to have a database connected Object for sequence like Clone and Contig.

Translating exons - The transcript object assumes that the sequence is continuous and all exon phases are inferred from the first exon.  This is not going to be true for non continuous sequence.

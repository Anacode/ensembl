Tony, Nicole, Henning, Tim, Michele
Peter.


Nicole has started putting fasta on ftp site. 


Need increments so we can we synchronize. - but we don't know ehre the
increments start from.

Nicole is going to dump everything this weekend then start adding increments so we know where we are.  Tim wants all human genomic and Greg Schuler's list. 

Nicole can't generate an sql query that regenerates Greg's list.

Tim wants to have a list of things that are in our human unfinished but not (yet) in Greg's list.


Web site - T. says we should be using mod-perl - talk next week.


Henning wants embl files to tremblize - he needs to talk to us (Ewan,James) about what he needs in the embl files.  He's only going to process CDS not exons.


Representing frameshifts in embl files. Can't represent insertions.  Someone (?) is working on this (by 1st sept by agreement with ncbi) but she's not working on this.   There is some  translational exception code in embl where you can say bases 5-8 code for such and such an amino acid.  We could use this to cover frameshifts.

Henning's trembl instructions. 
------------------------------

These are on the web.

Currently :

EMBL -> trembl.c -> flatfile tremblnew -> automatic annotation.

future -  embl to swissprot

Tags essential

protein  id - id and acc.
DR for orginal embl acc -(with version no.)

Description line - product, standard name, gene, note - lots of garbage here.
                   E.C number. Also the DE line from the EMBL entry.

most important are product, E.C. no.


If no product information but gene information do something like: 

   Hypothetical 41.9k protein - genename (fragment).

OS line - OC lines generated from this.

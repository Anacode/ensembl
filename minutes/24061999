Original dna sequence - in clone directories.

EMBL file generation - Ewan is going to use BioPerl.
T. Should have same code for Embl generation. James has
   code for fast EMBL file generation.

N.  Can dump out fasta - some problems in post-processing.
T.  How about unfinished to finished - we have to deal with this.
    As the AC stays the same - can merge finished and unfinished.


E. Exception hndling.


rethrowing - grep on the $@
if it isn't the error you want 
then die($@);

exceptions use the variable name - can put info in 
here on how the object was generated.  Will be seen
in exception output.


Pat. Asking why she was asked to look at locuslink.
   
E.   We need a map. Qustions need to be answered like - which clones
     are between two markers (and which genes).

Pat. Can already ask for STSs between two markers.  

N.   How to we get genome sequence onto map?

T.   Use ePCR?

E.   What is the datastructure?

Pat. RDB tables. E. want to have a look at these.

E.   Emphasize we need genetic map data as it most useful.

T.   Emphasizes that maybe we should invert the accepted way of doing thins
     way the map is seen as 'correct' and sequence is fitted to it and use the 
    map info as evidence when piecing together sequences.

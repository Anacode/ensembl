Generating the Schema Descriptions

The tables.txt and tables.html files are generated automatically from
the tables.xml. This requires an XML processor called Saxon which can
be downloaded from http://saxon.sourceforge.net/

When Saxon has been downloaded and installed, edit process-saxon.sh
and make sure that the -jar argument in each of the two Java calls
points to the location of your saxon7.jar file.

Then run the process-saxon.sh shell script and the .txt and .html
files will be created.


Editing the Schema Description

If you need to edit the schema description, edit tables.xml (according
to the rules in schema_description.dtd) and re-run the processing
stage as above to regenerate the .html and .txt files.

The XML stylesheets for creating the HTML and text (Wiki format) from
the XML are in xml2html.xsl and xml2wiki.xsl - you shouldn't need to
edit these unless you are adding a new feature to the processing step.

Updates
-------

Ewan, Jan 2000.


Updates are concerned with the following "top level"
objects.

	Genes
	Clones
	Exons

They can be deleted,added and updated. Only when we
remove Genes do we archive information. 

The rules for Clone updates differ, as a Clone update
triggers the update of a gene, irregardless of the
version number of the gene. This is because the coordinate
system may have changed.


Updates have to follow the following logic:


Connect to donor database,

	get list of Ghost objects.
		Remove deleted objects, potentially archiving genes.
	
	get list of updated objects.
	        Do Clone objects first.
		Update Clone objects.

		Update all genes on Clone objects, archiving
		them only if their version is higher. Otherwise
		delete the gene object even if the version is the same.

		write new gene objects

		Do Gene/Other objects (maybe already transfered from
		above, but the normal don't transfer if version number
		is equal applies).
